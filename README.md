This project is a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors real-time network traffic to detect cyber threats . It utilizes Scapy to capture live network packets, extracts key flow-based features, and applies a Random Forest Classifier to classify network activity as normal or malicious. T The system continuously analyzes packet sizes, inter-arrival times, byte rates, and protocol details, logging detected threats for further analysis. This IDS enhances network security by providing real-time attack detection.
